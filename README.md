# Waterford City Route Finder

Group Project: Semester 4
> Completed Independantly 


## Description

This project allows the user to select two points by clicking on a map of Waterford City, and find the best route from source to destination using one of a number of shortest-path algorithms (including ***Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search***). 

The JavaFX GUI uses the nodes and vertices in the ***custom graph-based data structure*** to identify and mark the chosen route on the map as blue pixels.

An assortment of J-Unit tests are included ensuring method's integrity despite code refactoring.
